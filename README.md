# dcgan-facegeneration

This is my submission for the fourth project in the Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree. The objective was to teach a computer how to draw faces using a DC GAN with Tensor Flow 1.0.0. I used a NVIDIA 1080 GTX card and it took roughly 30 minutes to iterate 1 epoch.

Faces were garbled at the end of the epoch but would be better if training was done for more training iterations.
